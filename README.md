# Products-API-books-
This is an API that records some products, books, for instance. But can be addapted to any other necessity.

It's done in Python, using Flask framework and SQLAlchemy as database.

For now it's just the backend, with the CRUD basic operations, and some filters. It was debugged using Postman.
